## Introduction
Welcome to the **FourThirdsEye** project, an open-source camera board designed for Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 boards using the IMX585. This project aims to provide a high-quality, affordable, and accessible camera module for advanced Raspberry Pi projects. The board is designed using KiCad v6, a popular open-source electronics design automation (EDA) software.

FourThirdsEye captures stunning high-resolution images and videos with improved low-light performance and dynamic range. It's perfect for photography enthusiasts, developers, and makers who want to level up their Raspberry Pi projects with a powerful camera.

## Features
* IMX294 sensor
* **Open-source hardware and software**
* Integrated TMP117 temperature sensor
* Compatible with Raspberry Pi5 and Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 boards with a 22-pin FPC connector and 4-lane MIPI-CSI (same pinout as Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 IO Board)
